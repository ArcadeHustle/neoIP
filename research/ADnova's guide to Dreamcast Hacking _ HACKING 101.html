No GS pro, no game trainers, no hacking utilities to <br />use (not yet anyway). I wrote this guide to help people who want to<br />hack their own codes for the DC. Where I can I'll use examples to <br />clarify how to use a code. Any problems or questions about the guide<br />or DC hacking, let me know. <br /><br />One important thing - you must have either a Code Breaker or an <br />Xploder to hack your own codes. You can try with the Game shark<br />CDX, but this guide won't help you with that device. The reason is<br />because Gameshark CDX codes are encrypted, which makes many of the<br />hacking methods described below difficult or impossible. <br /><br />Also, throughout the guide I will only refer to the Code Breaker, <br />however all of the guide can be applied using the Xploder.<br /><br />I have assumed that the reader has at least some basic knowledge of<br />hacking for other platforms, but the review is there for those that <br />don't.<br /><br />This is the first guide I've ever written, so I guarantee that there<br />will be something wrong somewhere. <br /> <br />A) -- What's new --<br /><br />Version 1.11 - Since this guide is now up at Hacking 101, I fixed up <br />some mistakes and tried to make certain parts easier to understand.<br /><br />Version 1.01 - A few minor updates, spelling/grammar fixes, and stuff<br />like that. <br /><br />Version 1.00 - First version of this guide. I plan on adding much more<br />information about Dreamcast hacking, as soon as I learn it myself.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />2) Review of basic hacking methods and knowledge<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />If you're already an experienced hacker, then go ahead and skip this<br />section. If not, then read up and hopefully you'll learn something. <br />Also - all numbers in this guide are hex numbers, unless stated <br />otherwise.<br /><br />--Hex--<br />First of all, you need to learn hex. Hex is a counting system that has<br />16 digits instead of the normal 10. It's really quite simple, but you<br />should at least be familiar with it before you try to hack anything. <br />Why should you learn it? Well, because every code you see is actually<br />in hex. So, if you want to make your own codes, you need to know what <br />the numbers mean.<br /><br />This table shows you all you need to know for now:<br /><br />Decimal number Hex number (a.k.a. hexadecimal)<br /> <br /> 0 ----&gt; 0<br /> 1 ----&gt; 1<br /> 2 ----&gt; 2<br /> 3 ----&gt; 3<br /> 4 ----&gt; 4<br /> 5 ----&gt; 5<br /> 6 ----&gt; 6<br /> 7 ----&gt; 7<br /> 8 ----&gt; 8<br /> 9 ----&gt; 9<br /> 10 ----&gt; A<br /> 11 ----&gt; B<br /> 12 ----&gt; C<br /> 13 ----&gt; D<br /> 14 ----&gt; E<br /> 15 ----&gt; F<br /> 16 ----&gt; 10<br /><br />This is just meant to give you an idea of how it works. Save yourself<br />the headache of trying to convert from one to the other and just use<br />a program that converts hex to decimal (and vice-versa). If you have <br />windows, use windows calculator with scientific view.<br /><br />--Anatomy of a code: Addresses, values, prefixes, floats and bytes--<br /><br />Hold on to your brain - this could get complicated. <img src="//storage.proboards.com/forum/images/smiley/smiley.png" alt=":)" class="smile"><br /><br />First, you should know the layout of a basic Dreamcast code:<br /><br />0?-AAAAAF<br />VVVVVVVV <br /><br />The prefix: the prefix is the ? in the code. It tells the Code Breaker<br />what type of code you're using. <br /><br />The address: this is the AAAAA in the code. This is what part of the <br />RAM that the code will be affecting. <br /><br />The float: The float is the F digit in the code. This is part of the <br />address.<br /><br />The value: The value is the VVVVVVVV in the code. The value tells the <br />Dreamcast what number to put at the address. <br /><br />To better explain what each part does, and what a byte is, look at the<br />following figure: (This will look familiar if you've ever used a hex <br />editor)<br /><br /> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F<br /><br />0C32EFA? 00 00 00 00 FF 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00<br /><br />Explanation: the number 0C32EFA? is the address. For now, you can <br />ignore the 0C part of the address. All DC RAM addresses have 0C at the front<br />of the address, because that's where DC's RAM is located (more about that<br />later). It is not the prefix, and it isn't actually used when inputing a Code<br />Breaker code. <br />The hex numbers from 0 to F above the sets of double zero's are also<br />part of the address. Each double zero is a 'byte' and that is where the values <br />are located. Here, we have the value 'FF' at address '0C32EFA4'. The 4 in the <br />address comes from the part where the value is located. Here it's 4, so the <br />address is 0C32EFA4 (and 4 replaces the ?). For future reference, this part<br />of the address will be called the 'float'. Make sense?<br /><br />One futher note: a byte is made up of two hexadecimal digits. It does NOT<br />have to be two zero's. I use zero's just to make it clear what is being <br />affected or changed.<br /> <br />If this were an actual code, it might be:<br /><br />00-32EFA4<br />000000FF<br /><br />That's all you need to know for now, next to know are the different <br />prefixes that you can use.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />3) Dreamcast Code Breaker code types<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />What a code does depends on the prefix. The prefix tells the Xploder<br />what to do with the numbers that follow. That said, that are several<br />code types (meaning: what prefix the code has), that you should know <br />about. Each will be explained in more detail later, this is just a <br />general overview. All of the information on code types here is based on <br />the information at <a href="http://www.cmgsccc.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.cmgsccc.com</a><br /><br /><br />00 code type: This code has '00' as a prefix. The normal layout of this<br />type of code is:<br /><br />00-AAAAAF<br />000000VV<br /><br />As you can see, the value (VV) is only one byte. The value must be between<br />00 and FF, since the first six zero's in the value are ignored.<br />The float(F) can have any value, from 0-F.<br /><br /><br />01 code type: The prefix for this code type is '01'. The float for this <br />code type must be even, ie: 0,2,4,6,8,A,C,E. The code looks like this:<br /><br />01-AAAAAF<br />000000VV<br /><br />You'll notice that this code type affects two bytes (VV VV), so the value <br />can be from 0000-FFFF. The first four zero's are ignored. <br /><br /><br />02 code type: This type of code affects four bytes, and is laid out like <br />this:<br /><br />02-AAAAAF<br />VVVVVVVV<br /><br />Here, the float must be 0,4,8, or C. The value here can be from 00000000 <br />to FFFFFFFF. <br /><br /><br />Right now you might be wondering why the float has to be certain values<br />for the different code types. Let me explain with an example, from<br />Skies of Arcadia:<br /><br />Ship parts item modifier (slot one):<br /><br />01-56E704<br />0000?<img src="//storage.proboards.com/forum/images/smiley/huh.png" alt="???" class="smile"> &lt;---item digit goes here.<br /><br />Max ship parts modifier (slot one):<br /><br />01-56E706<br />00000063<br /><br />Note that both codes are 01 code types. This means that they each affect <br />two bytes, but there's more to it than that. Lets break down the first<br />code:<br /><br /><br /> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F<br /><br />0C56E704 00 00 00 00 ?? ?? 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00<br /><br />Since the 01 code type affects two bytes, it also affects two float <br />numbers. Let's look at the second code:<br /><br /> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F<br /><br />0C56E706 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 63 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00<br /><br />This code affects two bytes, and the float from 6-7. We can easily combine<br />these two codes, with the 02 code type. <br /><br />Max ship parts item modifier (slot one):<br /><br />02-56E704<br />0063?<img src="//storage.proboards.com/forum/images/smiley/huh.png" alt="???" class="smile"><br /><br />The code would look like this:<br /><br /> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F<br /><br />0C56E704 00 00 00 00 ?? ?? 00 63 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00<br /><br />The 02 code type affects four bytes and four floats. <br /><br />Since the 02 type codes write to four bytes (and floats), <br />it can only start at every fourth float. Confusing enough? Anyway, back<br />to the different code types:<br /><br />04 code type: This code type has basically the same effect as the '50' code<br />type on the Gameshark Pro for Playstation. It's useful to combine many <br />codes into one. I'll save explanation of this code type until later, <br />here's the layout and brief explanation for now:<br /><br />04-AAAAAF<br /><a href="" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a><br />VVVVVVVV<br /> <br />The AAAAAF is the address where the code starts. WWWW is the number of<br />addresses that the code will affect. ZZZZ is how much the current address<br />is to be incremented by to get to the next address in the code, mulitplied <br />by four. The reason that ZZZZ is multiplied by four is because the value<br />written to each address in the code, VVVVVVVV, is the same type that<br />the 02 code type has. Meaning that at each address, four bytes are <br />written to. That also means that the float must be 0,4,8, or C.<br /><br />05 code type: The layout:<br /><br />05-AAAAAF<br />VVVVVVVV<br />ZZZZZZZZ <br /><br />This code will copy ZZZZZZZZ number of bytes from the address AAAAAF,<br />to the address VVVVVVVV. Normal codes only allow you to write to the <br />DC RAM, addresses 0C000000-0CFFFFFF. Well with this code you can write<br />to any area in the DC memory. The float in this code can range from 0-F.<br />More about this code type later. <br /><br />0B code type: Codes with prefixes '0B' seem to be enable codes. I have only <br />seen them used on two games, Shenmue and F355 Challenge. That's pretty much<br />all I know about them. <br /><br />0D code type: An activator code, similar to the D0 type code used on<br />Nintendo 64 and Playstation. The layout for this code type is:<br /><br />0D-AAAAAF<br />000ZVVVV<br /><br />This code will check a certain condition, indicated by the value of Z. <br />The possible Z values are:<br /><br />0 = If equal to <br />1 = If different to<br />2 = If less than<br />3 = If greater than<br /><br />The code reads the condition type, then goes to address AAAAAF and checks<br />the value(VVVV) at that address. If the condition is true, then it <br />'activates' the next two line code. If not, then it doesn't activate the<br />next two lines. To clarify, you would actually enter four lines under <br />one code description, something like this:<br /><br />0D-123456<br />00000001<br />01-123456<br />0000000A<br /><br />In this example, Z=0, so the condition is If equal to. The value at address <br />123456 is checked, and if it is equal to 1, then the next two line code is<br />activated. As you can see, when the next two line code is activated, the <br />value at address 123456 becomes A. <br /><br />0E code type: This code type is also an activator, but is used to activate<br />more than 2 lines of codes. Layout:<br /><br />0E-WWVVVV<br />0ZAAAAAF<br /><br />All of the terms have the same definitions as in the 0D code type, but<br />there is now one new term, WW. The value in WW tells the Code Breaker how<br />many lines of codes to activate if the condition is true. The value<br />in WW can be odd or even. This code type will be explained in more detail <br />later on. <br /><br /><br />0F code type:<br /><br />The following information is taken straight from Code Master's DC code<br />types FAQ (although it's slightly modified to be consistent):<br /><br />"Format: 0F-AAAAAF<br /> 0000VVVV<br /><br />AAAAAF = Address<br />VVVV = 2-byte Value <br /><br />Functionality: This is one of the least common code types. <br />It simply writes the given 2 byte value, VVVV, to the given address,<br />AAAAAF BEFORE anything is run for the game. Used for games like PSO that <br />require Enable Codes and such. (The float MUST be even.)" <br /><br />So, as you can see this code will write to the specified location before<br />the game even starts to run. And also, the float must be 0,2,4,8,A,C, or<br />E, just like the 01 code type. That is all I'm going to say about this<br />code type in this version of the guide.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />4) Uses of the different code types<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />The first three code types we deal with are quite simple (00, 01, and <br />02 types). What prefix to use depends on either the size of the value, <br />or how many bytes you want to change. <br /><br />A) -- 00 code type --<br /><br />Use this code type when you only want to change the value in one byte.<br /><br />Example: Say you want a code to give you 'max health' in a game. If the <br />max health you can get in the game is 270F (9999 decimal), that means that<br />the code you use should affect two bytes, but what happens if you used the<br />00 code type? Look at the following example:<br /><br /> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F<br /><br />0C320BA4 00 00 00 00 ?? ?? 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00<br /><br />So, for this game, the addresses that control health are 320BA4 and <br />320BA5. That covers two bytes and floats, and 00 affects only 1. If you<br />entered the code:<br /><br />00-32BA25<br />000000FF<br /><br />Then it would only affect the byte at float 5, leaving the byte at the<br />fourth float unchanged. <br /><br />The point of all of this is that you have to know how many bytes you need<br />to affect with the code, which you'll know by how large or small the <br />number is in the game (usually).<br /><br />What the 00 code type is good for is pinpointing very specific addresses. <br />The first six zero's in the value are ignored, it doesn't write these<br />zero's to any address.<br /><br />Example: Skies of Arcadia, Vyse name change modifier. <br /><br />In this code, each character in the name takes up one byte. Since you<br />want to make each character different, you must use the 00 code type <br />(well, not really, but this is just an example).<br />The address and values would look like this:<br /><br /> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F<br /><br />0C56DD70 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? 00 00 00 00 00 00 00<br /><br />The question marks are where you would put the values for whatever <br />character you wanted that part of the name to be. <br />You should note that two 02 type codes could be used here, much more <br />effective than eight 00 type codes. Generally, just use the 00 code type<br />if you're sure that you only need or want to change the value of one byte.<br /><br />B) -- 01 code type --<br /><br />The 01 prefix is used when you want to change two bytes with the same<br />code. When the value you want to change ranges from 0000-FFFF, use this<br />code type. <br /><br />Example: Grandia 2, Max MP for Mareg:<br /><br />01-E2E59C<br />000003E7<br /><br />In the usual form, the code looks like:<br /><br /> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F<br /><br />0CE2E59C 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 03 E7 00 00<br /><br />Note that the other bytes aren't necessarily zero's, I'm just doing<br />that to show what is being affected. Now, 3E7 = 999 in decimal, and that<br />is the maximum value that MP can be in this game. The game itself will<br />read both of these bytes to get the value for MP, so that is why the 01<br />code type should be used to change both of the bytes.<br /><br />C) -- 02 code type -- <br /><br />This code type is used to write to four bytes at once. It can be used when <br />the value you're changing is large, like this:<br /><br />Example: Grandia 2, Max experience Mareg. <br /><br />02-E2E590<br />05F5E0FF<br /><br />Which looks like:<br /><br /> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F<br /><br />0CE2E590 05 F5 E0 FF 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00<br /><br />05F5E0FF = 99,999,999 in decimal, which is the maximum value that the <br />game uses for experience. <br /><br />The 02 code type is not just used for large numbers. Remember, it affects<br />four bytes, so consider the following example:<br /><br />These codes are for the game Fur Fighters:<br /><br />Infinite pistol ammo, VLF facility level:<br /><br />01-E026D4<br />0000270F<br /><br />Infinite shotgun ammo, VLF facility level:<br /><br />01-E026D6<br />0000270F <br /><br />Knowing what you already know, you should easily see how we could<br />use the 02 code type to combine these codes.<br />Here is the combined code:<br /><br />02-E026D4<br />270F270F<br /><br />Which looks like this:<br /><br /> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F<br /><br />0CE026D4 00 00 00 00 27 0F 27 0F 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00<br /><br />Understand? The first code wrote 270F at float 4, while the second code <br />wrote 270F at float 6. Why not just write 270F at both with one code?<br /><br />That's it for the basic code types. The rest of the code types have <br />special features that you'll definitely want to use. <br /><br />D) -- 04 code type --<br /><br />If you've hacked codes for Playstation, it's almost certain that you've <br />used the '50' code type. Well, on DC the '04' code type has pretty much<br />the same effect, but of course there are some differences. This code is <br />more complex than the ones we've already covered, but I'll try to explain<br />how it works as best I can.<br /><br />For example, say you had four different codes, and they were:<br /><br />02-7798B0 02-7798B4 02-7798B8 02-7798BC<br />01FF01FF 01FF01FF 01FF01FF 01FF01FF<br /><br />These codes would be:<br /><br /> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F<br /><br />0C7798B0 01 FF 01 FF 01 FF 01 FF 01 FF 01 FF 01 FF 01 FF<br /><br />You should notice that the floats for these codes are 0,4,8,C. We know the<br />layout of the 04 code type, so how do we use it? It's simple actually.<br /><br />04-AAAAAF<br /><a href="" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a><br />VVVVVVVV<br /><br />First: obviously, the prefix used is 04. Next, what is the start address?<br />In this example it is 7798B0, so put that number in AAAAAF. Then figure <br />out how many codes you need to combine. There are four codes in this <br />example, so WWWW = 0004. The ZZZZ equals how much you want to increment <br />the address by for every code, multiplied by four. Here, each addresses <br />is 4 more than the previous one, so ZZZZ = 0001. Why is it multiplied by<br />four? That's explained by the value, VVVVVVVV. The code will write to <br />four bytes at each address (just like the 02 code type), which means that<br />the next bytes written to must be a separate four bytes.<br />Probably the most important thing to remember is that the 04 code type is<br />the same as using WWWW number of 02 type codes. <br />The number of addresses that this code can affect can be up to FFFF. <br /><br />Example: If you put in the code:<br /><br />04-000000<br />FFFF0001<br />FFFFFFFF<br /><br />Then the code would write FF at every byte of every address from 000000 to<br />FFFFFF (which is a very bad idea for a code, but it's just an example,<br />right?)<br /><br />What about different values of ZZZZ? Well, usually ZZZZ will be equal to <br />0001, but there may be times when you want to jump to an address that<br />isn't right next to the last one. For example, if some codes you wanted<br />to combine had a difference of 120 between each one, then ZZZZ would equal <br />30. Don't forget, ZZZZ is multiplied by four.<br />If you remember from the Playstation GS pro, you could add one to the<br />value for every code in the string. Unfortunately, you can't do that<br />on Dreamcast.<br /><br />E) -- 05 code type --<br /><br />With this code you can copy the values in a certain number of bytes, and <br />put them at a different address. <br />The catch here is that the address you can copy to doesn't have to <br />be in RAM. Just to remind you, the layout is:<br /><br />05-AAAAAF<br />BBBBBBBB<br />ZZZZZZZZ <br /><br />The copy-from address, AAAAAF, is an address in the normal RAM. <br />The copy-to address BBBBBBBB can be anywhere. Here is a memory map of<br />the DC that you can use, compiled by several people in the DC hobbyist <br />community, with special thanks to Dan Potter:<br /><br />00000000 - 03FFFFFF 00000000 - 001FFFFF Boot ROM (2MB)<br /> 00200000 - 003FFFFF Flash ROM (256K)<br />04000000 - 07FFFFFF Video RAM (8MB)<br />08000000 - 0BFFFFFF ?<br />0C000000 - 0CFFFFFF System RAM (16MB)<br />10000000 - 13FFFFFF PowerVR:<br /> 10000000 - 107fffff Tile accelerator<br /> 10800000 - 11ffffff Texture mem (wronly)<br />14000000 - 17FFFFFF G2/Expansion (modem) port, 1-4 bytes/access<br />1C000000 - 1FFFFFFF Internal I/O registers<br />1F000000 - 1FF0?<img src="//storage.proboards.com/forum/images/smiley/huh.png" alt="???" class="smile"> Memory mapped registers<br />A05F8000 PowerVR registers<br />A0700000 SPU Registers<br />A0800000 - A09FFFFF Sound RAM (2MB)<br />A1000000 Parallel port; Mappable for PCI bus space <br /> (used with the broadband adapter)<br />A2000000 CD/GD-ROM port<br />A4000000 Non-cached mirror of texture RAM<br />A5000000 - A57FFFFF Non-cached mirror of VRAM<br />FF000000 - FFF0?<img src="//storage.proboards.com/forum/images/smiley/huh.png" alt="???" class="smile"> Mirror of memory mapped registers<br /><br /><br />If you're experienced enough, this code type can let you change nearly<br />any area of DC memory. The normal area of DC RAM, 0C000000 - 0CFFFFFF, <br />can be categorized further, but I'll save that information for the <br />"Hacking with Code Breaker" section.<br /><br />Now, obviously if you want to copy from a certain address you have to<br />know what it is you're copying. So you can do one of two things. <br />One, you can write whatever value you want to a specific location in <br />the normal RAM area, then copy that value to another location in DC <br />memory (not necessarily RAM).<br />Or two, you can copy an unchanged value from RAM to another memory area. <br /><br />If you can just use the other code types, why would you use this code<br />type to change values in RAM? Well, because the values in the<br />address you copy to change dynamically. <br /><br />Example: In an RPG, a certain characters stats might be at the address<br />0C4599A2. All the stats for that character are contained within, say, <br />32 bytes. Now, another characters stats are located at address 0C4599DD.<br />If you used the code:<br /><br />05-4599A2<br />0C4599DD<br />00000032<br /><br />Then those 32 bytes would be copied from one characters stats to the <br />others. This is useful because nothing is being altered or written to at<br />the copy from address (4599A2). You should also be aware that this code<br />doesn't just copy the values once, it is a continuos copy. So, when the<br />byte values at the copy from address change, so do the values at the <br />copy to address. <br />Note: the Code Breaker reads the number of bytes to copy as a decimal<br />number, so beware.<br /><br />F) -- 0D code type --<br /><br />These last two code types, 0D and 0E, are activator codes. You may be<br />familiar with that term if you've used those type of codes on N64 and<br />Playstation. Instead of having a different prefix for each condition,<br />on the DC the condition is just one digit in the code. <br /><br />Example: The 0D type activator is useful if you want to have codes like:<br />get 99 coins when you pick up one, or win one fight instead of two to <br />win the match, etc..<br /><br />To use the 'get 99 coins' example above, you first have to know the address<br />that contains the values for number of coins. Let's say for example that<br />the address was 2290BC. Normally when you start a level you'd have no coins.<br />If you remember the layout, the AAAAAF here would be 2290BC, the address<br />where the coins are. The condition type Z, would be 0, which means If <br />equal to. The VVVV would be 1, because that's the number we'd need to <br />activate the code that follows. Here's what the code would look like:<br /><br />0D-2290BC<br />00000001<br />00-2290BC<br />00000063<br /><br />So, the game checks the value at address 2290BC, and when it is equal <br />to 1, the next two line code is activated. In this example, when you <br />pick up 1 coin, the next code becomes active, and writes 63 (which is<br />99 in decimal) at address 2290BC.<br /><br />G) -- 0E code type --<br /><br />The 0E code type is similar to the 0D code type, with the addition of<br />one important term - WW. This WW controls how many lines you want to <br />activate if the condition is true. <br /><br />Example: Good for sports games, if you want to start the game with a<br />lead on the other team. You need to know the addresses that control<br />the score of both teams (usually away and home). If the home team score<br />address is 1C0920 and the away team score address is 1C0924, then you <br />have all you need to make this type of code. The code might look like:<br /><br />0E-040000<br />001C0920<br />00-1C0920<br />00000064<br />00-1C0924<br />00000000<br /><br />The code will check the value at address 1C0290, which is the home team<br />score address. The condition here is If equal to, so if the value at <br />that address = VVVV (0000 in this example), then activate the next WW<br />amount of lines. WW equals 04 in this example. At the beginning of the <br />game, the home team score is 0, so the activator takes effect right away.<br />It then writes the value 64 (99 decimal) to the home score address , and<br />gives the away team a 0. <br /><br />This code type is also used for Dreamcast Joker command codes, which<br />will be discussed in the next section. <br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />5) Dreamcast Joker commands<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Joker commands are used with activator codes, so that you can activate<br />the code just by pressing a button. They are very useful codes, and can<br />be used with both 0D and 0E type activators. The list below contains<br />the joker command codes for the different buttons. This list was<br />compiled by UL1 on the X-hub message board:<br /><br />Button Joker code<br /><br /> A FFFB<br /> B FFFD<br /> X FBFF<br /> Y FDFF<br /> START FFF7<br /> D-UP FFEF<br /> D-DOWN FFDF<br /> D-LEFT FFBF<br /> D-RIGHT FF7F <br /><br /><br />The following instructions are based on what CodeMaster wrote in his<br />joker code FAQ:<br />To combine two joker commands (i.e. press A and Y to activate a code), you <br />have to add the joker codes for the buttons together. For example, the <br />joker code for A and B would be:<br /><br />A = FFFB<br />B = FFFD<br /><br />FFFB + FFFD = 1FFF8<br /><br />However, the joker code is only four digits, so you add the 1 at the<br />beginning to the last digit, to get the combined joker code. So the joker <br />command for pressing both A + B buttons is FFF9.<br /><br />A) How to use joker commands in DC codes<br /><br />To illustrate how these work, I'll use some codes for World series <br />baseball 2K1 as examples.<br /><br />The first and most important thing you must have in order to use joker<br />commands is the address that tells the DC what buttons you are pressing.<br />To be honest, there is almost no possiblity that you'll be able to find out <br />this address with just the Code Breaker or Xploder. If the address for<br />this function is already known, however, then you're ready to use joker<br />commands. <br /><br /> -- Using the 0D activator with joker commands --<br /><br />From world series baseball 2K1:<br /><br />0D-25D5A8<br />0000FFEB<br />0199E188<br />00000000<br /><br />Code effect: Press A + D-pad up to make away team score = 0<br /><br />In this code, the address that the condition is checked from is the<br />address that records what buttons are being pressed, 25D5A8. The <br />condition is 0000, so it's an If equal to type of condition. The<br />FFEB is the value that the Code Breaker checks for at the address. FFEB is <br />a joker command for A + D-pad up. So, when you press A + D-pad up at<br />the same time, the condition returns true and the following two lines<br />are activated. The address 99E188 is the away team score address, that <br />contains the value for the current away team score. When you press the<br />joker command buttons that activate the code, the Code Breaker will write<br />0000 at the address 99E188. Note that there's only four zero's being <br />written because the code type being activated is an 01 type. <br /><br /> -- Using the 0E activator with joker commands --<br /><br />Also for World series baseball 2K1:<br /><br />0E-04FD5F<br />0025D5A8<br />01-99E188<br />00000032<br />01-99E18C<br />00000000<br /><br />Code effect: Press Y + D-pad down to put away team in the lead.<br /><br />According to the code layout:<br /><br />0E-WWVVVV<br />0ZAAAAAF<br /><br />WW is the number of lines the code will activate. VVVV contains the<br />four digit joker command. 0Z is the condition type, and AAAAAF is<br />the address that the Code Breaker will check the condition from.<br /><br />In this example, the condition is 00, If equal to. The number of lines<br />to activate is 04, and FD5F is the joker command for Y + D-pad down. <br />The address you put at AAAAAF is the address that records the values for<br />whatever buttons you press. For World Series Baseball 2K1, that address<br />is 25D5A8. Note that this address is different for every game. <br />We know that 99E188 is the away team score modifier, and we now know that<br />99E18C is the home team score modifier. When Y + D-pad up are pressed, the<br />value at address 25D5A8 becomes FD5F, and the next WW (04 here) number of <br />lines are activated. The next two codes set the away team score to 32 <br />(in hex, which is 50 in decimal) and the home team score to 0. <br /><br />On a side note, you should realize that the two 01 type codes in this <br />example could be combined into one 02 type code. You would just need to<br />change WW from 04 to 02. It would look something like this:<br /><br />0E-02FD5F<br />0025D5A8<br />02-99E188<br />00320000<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />6) Hacking with Code Breaker<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />When you're trying to hack with the Code Breaker, you have only two methods,<br />guessing and modifying. If you've gotten used to using GS pro's, then<br />trying to poke around to find codes with the Code Breaker will remind you<br />of the days of the Game Genie. Well, okay, it's not quite that bad. <br /><br />Modifying is definitely the best way to find your own codes for DC. <br />For most games, a certain area of RAM will contain almost all the memory<br />that controls important things, such as lives, power, or score. So you can<br />just change the address on existing codes to find new ones. And for the <br />most part, it will work fine. Just remember what code type you're using, <br />and make sure the float can be used with that type. <br /><br />The 04 code type can give you the ability to change as many bytes as you<br />want with one code, so it's very useful for code searching. Well, sort <br />of. For example, if there was one code available for a game, and it <br />was 99 lives, player one. The code might be:<br /><br />00-ACC240<br />00000063<br /><br />You would know that the byte at address ACC240 controls the number of <br />lives for player one. Since most games group together the values that<br />affect similar things in a game, for instance player one stats, you <br />could do a 04 search. How would you do this? You could enter:<br /><br />04-ACC240<br />00040001<br />63636363<br /><br />What would this actually do? To put it in a familiar form:<br /><br /> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F<br /><br />0CACC240 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63 63<br /><br />It writes 63 to all the bytes from ACC240-ACC24F. When you start your <br />game, check player one's stats, and see if any have changed to 99. If<br />any did, then you've found some codes!<br /><br />Another way of modifying codes is to use the 0D and 0E activator codes.<br />All you need is the addresses for two different things you want to <br />change, and you can have your new code. Even better, if you know the<br />address that contains the values for the buttons you press, you can <br />easily create joker command codes for nearly anything you want. <br />This is where the 0E activator code type can be useful. Use it with <br />04 and 05 code types, or any code you want to activate that has more <br />than two lines. <br /><br />To sum it up, modifying existing codes is by far the most effective <br />method of hacking with the Code Breaker. <br /><br /><br />Of course, for those of you with the patience, you could try the classic<br />"guessing" method. I have to admit though, I haven't found a single code<br />using this method with Code Breaker DC yet, but don't let that stop you. <br />When you're dealing with FFFFFF different addresses to choose from, <br />you'll want to cover as much ground as you can with each code. Forget <br />using the 00, 01, or 02 code types. You'll need to use the 04 code type. <br />This method is totally primitive, but you're not restricted to modifying<br />codes. A sample code:<br /><br />04-200000<br />00500001<br />FFFFFFFF<br /><br />This code will write FF to every byte from address 0C200000 to 0C200140<br />(50 * 4, in hex). <br />Assuming the game will start, you now must look for anything that has<br />changed. Now is where extreme patience comes in to play. Go through <br />every menu, get in a fight, go buy something at a town, look to see<br />if anything is different. For example, when you put in the above<br />code and try to buy something in a town and everything is much<br />more expensive than before, then you've probably found the address<br />that affects the prices of certain items. <br />There is a catch-22 when using this code finding method. You can write <br />a value to any number of bytes, up to FFFF * 4. Writing to that many <br />bytes at once will greatly increase your chances of finding something.<br />At the same time, there is a greater chance of locking up your game. <br />Also, if you do find a good effect when using this method, depending<br />on how many addresses you're writing to it might be nearly impossible<br />to find what address contains the value you want to change. Basically,<br />use this method at your own risk!<br /><br />The following info, sent to me by Dan Potter, will probably be useful<br />to you if you want to guess your own codes:<br /><br />0C000000 - 0C008000 : in-RAM BIOS space (syscalls, etc); a small <br /> chunk of the BIOS is copied here on startup <br /> and this contains some library hooks like<br /> CD access<br /><br />0C008000 - 0C010000 : IPL space (bootstrap containing the SEGA <br /> license screen,etc)<br /><br />0C010000 - 0D000000 : program (and memory heap) grows upward in <br /> this space, stack grows downward from the top<br /><br />If you want to guess your own codes, it would probably be a good idea<br />to stay out of the area from 0C000000 to 0C010000, unless you know<br />what you're doing and you want to change something there.<br />I guess all I can say now is good luck. <img src="//storage.proboards.com/forum/images/smiley/smiley.png" alt=":)" class="smile"><br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />7) Credits and Thank-you's<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />-- The first people I must thank (and give credit to) are CodeMaster<br /> and VB|Daryl from <a href="http://www.cmgsccc.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.cmgsccc.com</a>.
